<h1>Cook</h1>
<p>Cook is a fast incremental build tool intended for projects in <a href="http://dlang.org">D programming language</a>.</p>
<p>In contrast to most other build automation programs, Cook by default requires no project hierarchy description - it automatically collects information about imports from D source files in project directory. Moreover, Cook caches dependencies between modules, and then uses this cache to find out which modules had been changed and need recompiling.</p>
<p>Cook is written in D and supports Windows and Linux. By default it works with Digital Mars D compiler (DMD), but you can use it with other compilers (and, for some extent, even with other languages!) as well by writing proper configuration file.</p>
